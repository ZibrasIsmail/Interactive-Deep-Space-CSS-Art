# Cosmic Canvas: Interactive Deep Space CSS Art

## Description

Cosmic Canvas is an interactive, visually stunning representation of deep space created entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates the power of modern web technologies to create immersive, animated scenes without the need for heavy graphics libraries or complex rendering engines.

### Features

- Dynamic star field with twinkling effect
- Colorful, glowing galaxies
- Animated nebula background
- Central planet system with:
  - Main planet with atmospheric glow

This project serves as an excellent example of:

   - Use of gradients and shadows for texture
   - 3D transformations for orbital movements

2. JavaScript DOM manipulation:

   - Dynamically creating and positioning elements
   - Applying random properties for a more natural look

3. Performance optimization:

   - Using CSS animations for smooth performance
   - Efficient creation of multiple elements

4. Responsive design principles:
   - Ensuring the scene looks good on various screen sizes
